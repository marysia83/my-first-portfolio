                <p>My name is Marysia and I am an enthusiastic programmer, beginning a new journey through the land of codes and algorithms. I am originally from Polan, and living in US for over 15 years. I currently work as Research Administrator at School of Communication at Northwestern University. I am attending a Coding Bootcamp with intentions to learn all the mysteries behind web and app development.</p>
                <p>My main focus is on grants management and activities in sposnored projects. As a programmer, I would like to help non-profit organizations manage their sponsored projects portfolio by implementing systems and applications that would increase efficiency and accuracy, provide transparency in grants activities, and provide better audit preparation.</p>
                <p>When I am not working/studying, I indulge in outdoors activities, including rock climbing, mountain biking, camping and hiking, and ultra running on trails. If weather does not permit, I play bridge or watch classic movies.</p>
